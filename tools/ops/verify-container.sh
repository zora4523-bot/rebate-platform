#
#   (default)  `pnpm verify` — the task's verification; it alone decides the task. verify/<n>/
#   --fast     `pnpm run verify:fast` — the entry the Claude Opus implementation subagent uses for
#              its own test runs (default split of 2026-10-05, ops/approvals.yaml id 19). No
#              PostgreSQL, no Redis, `--network none`. verify-fast/<n>/; never evidence of
#              verification.
#   --red      the isolated red run of the rule tests Codex wrote (规划/11 §2.3 step 3; CR-12):
#              only the task's new rule-test files (inside its trusted test_paths, changed
#              against --base, default the branch point with origin/main), each run by the
#              trusted Vitest project that takes it (tools/ops/red-plan.ts, red-projects.json;
#              a file no project takes stops the run, CR2-04) with the trusted red reporter
#              (verify-image/red-reporter.mjs, keeps the failure causes, CR2-03); reports go to
#              red/<n>/out/<project>.json and tools/guard/red-check.ts reconciles them with the
#              expected list (exit code = red-check's). The groups whose project needs
#              PostgreSQL run in their own container with the one-shot PostgreSQL and Redis on the
#              internal network; all other groups run in a container with no network and no
#              database URL. A browser rule test (project `browser: true`, spec-browser) needs an
#              image with Playwright's browser: without playwright in the lockfile the run stops.
#   --browser  the browser tests: every browser project of red-projects.json, in its order, in one
#              container with `--network none` (loopback only) and the image's headless Chromium:
#              spec-browser (F1-01j: every test/spec/**/*.browser.test.{ts,tsx}, Vitest browser
#              mode) and build-smoke (F1-01k: builds the H5 entries and the admin console, serves
#              them on 127.0.0.1 and opens each one; every test/spec/**/*.smoke.test.ts).
#              Screenshots and one Vitest JSON report per project are exported to browser/<n>/out/
#              (screenshots/ — the build smoke's are screenshots/smoke-<entry>.png —,
#              <project>.vitest-report.json) for comparison with the design boards; the log counts
#              both kinds. Exit code = the first failing project's (every project still runs), or
#              1 when all passed but no screenshot was exported. Like --fast an implementer's own
#              check, never
#              evidence of verification (tools/ci/evidence-check.ts accepts verify and red only).
#   --dry-run  prints what would run (script, commit, tree, red files) as one JSON line and
#              starts nothing; no run directory is created.
#
# There is no host fallback (CR-01; 规划/11 §4.1, §8): every test or task file runs only in this
# container. `--host` is refused; without Docker the script stops (exit 2) and the run goes to CI.
#
# The container has no way out:
#   - per-run `--internal` network (or none); a one-shot PostgreSQL (TEST_PG_ADMIN_URL) and a
#     one-shot Redis (TEST_REDIS_URL) attached ONLY to it, no published port, data on tmpfs;
#   - worktree mounted read-only at /src and copied to a tmpfs before anything runs;
#   - dependencies from an offline pnpm store (volume keyed by the lockfile hash;
#     filled by one networked `pnpm fetch` that sees nothing but the lockfile and
#     pnpm-workspace.yaml);
#   - non-root, read-only root file system, no capabilities, no Docker socket; the red run
#     additionally mounts its own output directory (reports only);
#   - planning text for guards and tools tests comes from a read-only, single-commit
#     snapshot of the planning repository at SPEC_REF, mounted at /spec.
# Exit code = the exit code of the script run (124 = time limit); --red: red-check's. Exit code
# 2 = usage or infrastructure error (no result.json is written in that case).
#
# Output: <runs>/<id>/{verify,verify-fast,red,browser}/<n>/log.txt and result.json
#   { mode: container, script: verify|verify:fast|red|browser, exit_code, commit, tree,
#     prop_seed, started_at, finished_at }  — red adds red_tests, expected and reports (path +
#     sha256); browser leaves its screenshots and report in out/.
# `tree` is the git tree of the work tree as verified (uncommitted changes included). The tree
# is exported once into an immutable snapshot and that snapshot is what gets verified, so the
# hash and the exit code always describe the same files; git-ignored paths never reach it.
#
# The image: tools/ops/verify-image/Dockerfile with the pnpm of `packageManager` and the
# Playwright browser of the lockfile's `playwright` version (none: no browser); both versions are
# part of the image tag, so a lockfile that moves either one builds a new image.
#
# This script, the Dockerfile and the entrypoint are gates: run them from the
# trusted root, never from the task worktree (规划/11 §2.4).
#
# Environment: COULI_RUNS, COULI_TRUSTED_ROOT, COULI_SPEC_REPO (conventions C7);
#   COULI_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_SECS (default 1200); COULI_VERIFY_PREFIX (default couli-verify;
#   prefix of every container, network and volume this script creates);
#   PROP_SEED / PROP_RUNS are passed through.
#
# Host services (owner 2026-10-08/09: no Docker on the orchestrating Mac; runs go to the AWS test
# machine, and the test database does not run in Docker there — plan A of 2026-10-09). With
# COULI_VERIFY_HOST_SERVICES=1 every run that needs databases (pnpm verify, the integration groups
# of --red) gets, instead of the PostgreSQL and Redis containers, a fresh one-shot PostgreSQL and
# Redis started from the host's installed binaries and removed after the run:
#   COULI_VERIFY_SVC_USER   unprivileged user the services run as (default couli-svc); it must
#                           have no group but COULI_VERIFY_SVC_GROUP
#   COULI_VERIFY_SVC_GROUP  group of the sockets (default couli-sock); only the run's container
#                           gets it (--group-add)
#   COULI_VERIFY_SVC_ROOT   tmpfs for the instances (default /var/lib/couli-ephemeral, 0700 user)
#   COULI_VERIFY_PG_BIN     PostgreSQL 18 binaries (default /usr/lib/postgresql/18/bin)
#   COULI_VERIFY_REDIS_BIN  directory of redis-server and redis-cli (default /usr/bin)
# The host is prepared once by couli-runs/RUNNER/setup-isolation.sh; this script needs sudo
# (systemd-run, systemctl, nft, install, rm) and flock. What changes in that mode, and nothing else:
#   - before the services start: the nftables table `inet couli_isolation` must reject every packet
#     of the services user (checked, plus a live probe as that user), else exit 2; one run at a
#     time on the whole host (flock on /run/lock/couli-host-services.lock, shared by every lane
#     and every COULI_RUNS; the lock dies with the process); the instance root must be the
#     dedicated tmpfs mount point (owned by the services user, 0700), else exit 2; whatever an
#     earlier killed run left (containers labelled couli.services=host, transient units
#     couli-svc-*, the directories of runs in the registry /run/lock/couli-host-services.runs, the
#     user's processes, /dev/shm, /dev/mqueue and SysV IPC objects) is removed first, or the run
#     stops (exit 2); an unregistered entry in the instance root is never removed (exit 2);
#   - initdb on the tmpfs (superuser postgres, a random password that exists only in this run; it
#     reaches initdb on stdin, never a command line), then postgres (listen_addresses='', unix
#     socket only, 0770 to the socket group) and redis-server (port 0, unix socket only, no RDB or
#     AOF, maxmemory 256mb noeviction as infra/local/compose.yaml / ADR-0001 §4.2 #17; MIGRATE,
#     REPLICAOF, SLAVEOF, MODULE, DEBUG, SAVE, BGSAVE, BGREWRITEAOF, SHUTDOWN, FAILOVER, SYNC,
#     PSYNC disabled, protected settings immutable; CONFIG stays for the rule tests' CONFIG GET),
#     each a transient systemd unit as the services user, sandboxed: own empty network namespace,
#     AF_UNIX only, IPAddressDeny=any, own IPC namespace (RemoveIPC), /tmp, /var/tmp and /dev/shm
#     inside the run directory on the tmpfs, read-only system, no /home, /root, /run, /Users,
#     /var/log, /data or the host services' configuration (Pigsty's passwords), only its own run
#     directory writable, no capabilities, no new privileges, @system-service calls only,
#     MemoryMax=4G, TasksMax=512, own /proc view, RuntimeMaxSec; whatever COPY ... PROGRAM starts
#     runs inside that sandbox too;
#   - the database container runs with `--network none` and gets only the run's socket directory
#     (the two sockets) read-only, the socket group, and a small proxy (node, written by this
#     script, mounted read-only) on 127.0.0.1:5432 / 127.0.0.1:6379 that forwards to the two
#     sockets: TEST_PG_ADMIN_URL is postgres://postgres:<password>@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres and
#     TEST_REDIS_URL redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 (packages/db/src/pg-url.ts and the test Redis probe
#     take host:port URLs only; pg_dump of db:check connects the same way);
#   - after the run (also on failure, time-out or signal) the units are stopped and the run
#     directory removed, each confirmed: a unit is stopped only when systemd says not-found, or
#     loaded and inactive / failed (no answer, an empty answer or a time-out is not stopped); no
#     process of the services user may be left; the directory must be reported absent (a check
#     that cannot run is not "absent"); no IPC or shared memory may be left. result.json is written
#     only after all that succeeded (a failed clean-up or a service that does not start is an
#     infrastructure error: exit 2, no result.json); the one-shot password is replaced in the log,
#     red-check.json and every regular file under out/ before the result is derived from them
#     (handed to node on stdin, never on a command line; a failure is exit 2); the database
#     container's whole docker run has a host-side hard limit (its own limit plus 15 minutes):
#     past it the containers are removed and the run stops with exit 2, no result;
#   - result.json has "gate" (recorded when the run starts: the trusted root's commit, whether its
#     tracked files equal that commit — an overlaid gate does not —, this script's sha256) and
#     "services": "host-ephemeral".
# Unset, the script behaves exactly as without these lines.
