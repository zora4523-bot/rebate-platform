// B3-05i · BR-AI-05 / BR-AI-06: card references in a tool's modelView. A tool builds its modelView
// before the run numbers its cards (numbering happens in RunContext.card, after execute returns),
// so it writes cardReference(ctx, index) where the model must see outcome.cards[index]'s card_id.
// After delivery the core replaces each reference with the delivered frame's card_id, or removes
// it when that card was not delivered, before the view reaches the model or the trace.
//
// Binding a reference to its tool call. The tool context carries no call id, and the run's signal
// must stay the run's own object (B3-05b#35), so neither can tell two calls apart. A new
// ToolContext field would not reach registry handlers either: tools/registry builds its
// ToolCallContext field by field. What every layer already forwards by reference is the
// placeholders table, so the core hands each execute call a fresh frozen copy of the run's table
// and keys the call's scope on that object's identity (a WeakMap, released with the call).
// Identity cannot be produced from model input or serialized data, so a reference can only be
// issued for a call by code holding that call's context. A wrapper that copies the table loses
// the binding and cardReference throws (the tool then fails) instead of binding to another call.
// Once the core has settled a call, its scope is closed and cardReference throws too, so a tool
// keeping an old context cannot issue references that would no longer be resolved.
