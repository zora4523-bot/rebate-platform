// Invalid model format (BR-AI-06: the model never outputs card JSON). When a round's whole text,
// after trimming and removing one ``` fence, is structured data — it opens with `{`, or is a JSON
// array / array-looking text, parseable or not — that text is never delivered (tool rounds and the
// final round alike). The {"agent_intent": …} handling runs first and is unchanged. Before any
// model / tool text, card or suggestions was delivered (input notices do not count, plan U-11) the
// run degrades exactly like "no usable model answer": DegradedPath with reason `models_failed`
// (done fallback, or whatever the path returns). After delivery the guard tail is flushed and the
// run ends done stop. OrchestratorTrace.model_format_invalid records the deviation.
