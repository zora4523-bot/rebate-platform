// Identity's ports of the deletion cleanup (task B1-15g §9.2 #4; 08 BR-ID-28, BR-AI-22,
// BR-FUND-24 ⑧; orchestrator rulings D10-137, D10-186). Declared here, implemented by the owning
// modules and handed in by app.module's assembly: identity never imports another module's
// application code for the cleanup.
//
// Cleanup ports (linking / growth / notification / agent / catalog): called inside identity's
// cleanup transaction (users row already locked), on the caller's transaction, re-entrant, with
// { appId, userId, at } (at = the step's Clock reading). A port whose owner has not shipped yet is
// assembled as a DeletionCleanupUnavailable marker: the rest of the cleanup still commits, but
// cleaned_at stays NULL (the request stays processing) and a daily cleanup_blocked warning names
// the port.
//
// Closing adjustment (D10-137 ①, BR-FUND-24 ⑧): asked inside the completion transaction; anything
// but none_needed / done keeps the request in processing. Until the funds port exists, app.module
// assembles closingAdjustmentFromBalance over DeletionBalanceReader (0 → none_needed, anything
// else → pending).
//
// Also compiled by the `test` project: erasable syntax only, `import type` for type-only imports,
// relative imports with `.ts`.
