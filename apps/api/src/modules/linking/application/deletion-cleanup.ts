// B1-06zc: linking's share of identity's deletion cleanup (08 BR-ID-28 细则「注销删除与保留范围」:
// 联盟绑定 blocked（deletion）; BR-ID-20; identity/ports/deletion-cleanup.ts DeletionCleanupStep),
// assembled by app.module in place of linking's unavailable marker.
// - Every union_bindings row of the user (this app only) that can still become blocked (active,
//   invalid, pending_auth) becomes blocked with blocked_reason deletion (row_version + 1,
//   updated_at = at; bound_at, relation_id and the release instants kept).
// - Rows already blocked keep their reason (a banned user's bindings stay ban, admin_disable
//   stays); released and unbound rows are untouched; no row is deleted or inserted; link_logs are
//   kept (BR-ID-30 ②).
// - Runs on identity's cleanup transaction (users row already locked) and is re-entrant: a second
//   call changes nothing. Rule tests: test/spec/linking/deletion-cleanup/**.
// - Takes the bindings' user lock (binding-lock.ts) like every other writer, then one set-based
//   UPDATE whose source statuses come from canTransitionBinding (no per-row compare-and-set: a
//   writer without the user lock, such as the inspection turning active into invalid, is waited
//   for by the row lock and the row is re-evaluated against the status set, so it is never
//   silently skipped).
// TODO(规划/11 §4.5): 换用生成的 transition() — blocked on CT-10 状态机生成器（approvals #26）
