// 「幂等 API」: idempotency_keys plus the business unique constraints as the last line).
// Implementation contract for task B1-01i. The rule tests
// in test/spec/platform/idempotency/** import this file by path; the names, signatures and
// semantics written here are the contract. Table shape: db/schema.sql (idempotency_keys after
// migration 0004: request_hash and response null exactly on abandoned rows; status processing /
// completed / abandoned; UNIQUE (app_id, subject, method, path, key)).
//
// 1. Who owns a key — `subjectOf(actor)` (规划/04 §5「幂等」)
//    actor = { userId, deviceId, phoneHmac }, each a string or null; the first non-null wins:
//      userId     → `u:<userId>`      logged-in request (the token's user)
//      deviceId   → `d:<deviceId>`    anonymous request with X-Device-Id
//      phoneHmac  → `p:<phoneHmac>`   landing page without a device (POST /v1/invites/landing-register;
//                                      the caller normalises the phone per BR-ID-05 and passes the
//                                      blind index of platform/crypto)
//    Formats (else IdempotencyError('invalid_subject')): userId and deviceId are lowercase
//    canonical UUID strings (/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/; both
//    are UUIDv7 issued by the server, 04 §5「字段」); phoneHmac is 64 lowercase hex characters. All
//    three null → IdempotencyError('invalid_subject'). Only the winning value is checked; the
//    later ones are ignored entirely (whatever they hold). The record's `user_id` column is
//    userId for a `u:` subject, else null.
//    Admin accounts have no idempotent operation in 04 §6.6 yet; no `a:` subject (待编排会话确认).
//
// 2. The key — header Idempotency-Key, contract schema IdempotencyKey: 8 to 64 characters of
//    [A-Za-z0-9_-] (contracts/openapi.yaml). Missing (undefined), empty or outside the format →
//    the response is 20001 (section 5), the handler does not run, the database is not touched.
//
// 3. The request hash — `requestHashOf(body)` = lowercase hex SHA-256 of the UTF-8 bytes of
//    `canonicalJson(body)` (BR-WDR-07: sha256(键名排序、无空白的规范化 JSON)).
//    `canonicalJson(body)`: `body` is the parsed JSON request body.
//      - undefined (no body at all) → '' (the empty string); this differs from null → 'null'.
//      - null, booleans, strings, finite numbers → JSON.stringify of the value (so -0 → '0',
//        1.0 → '1', strings keep JSON.stringify's escaping).
//      - arrays → '[' elements in their order, each canonical, joined by ',' ']'.
//      - plain objects (prototype Object.prototype or null) → '{' then for each own enumerable
//        string key, sorted by UTF-16 code units (the default Array.prototype.sort order, as RFC
//        8785), JSON.stringify(key) ':' canonical(value), joined by ',' '}'. Nothing is dropped:
//        a key whose value is null stays.
//      - no whitespace anywhere outside strings.
//      - anything else, at any depth (undefined inside an object or array, NaN, ±Infinity,
//        bigint, symbol, function, Date, Map, Buffer, any other class instance) →
//        IdempotencyError('invalid_request').
//      - nesting deeper than MAX_CANONICAL_DEPTH (256) arrays / objects (the top-level array or
//        object is depth 1; task B1-01zt) → IdempotencyError('invalid_request'), raised before
//        the encoder recurses that deep, so a deeply nested body never overflows the stack (a
//        RangeError would end as 50001). isNestingTooDeep(error) tells this error apart from the
//        other invalid_request errors (the HTTP layer answers it as 20001 with data.fields
//        ['body']); the mark lives outside the error object, which keeps section 10's own
//        properties.
//    Only the body is hashed: method, path, app and subject are part of the unique key instead.
//
// 4. One request — `idempotency.execute(request, handler)` (standard operations) and
//    `idempotency.executeInTransaction(request, handler)` (the four sensitive operations).
//    request = { appId, actor, method, path, key, body, traceId }:
//      appId    the token's app_id, non-empty string
//      method   'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE'
//      path     the concrete request path (path parameters filled in, so POST /v1/links/A/open and
//               POST /v1/links/B/open never share a record), starting with '/', without query
//               string or fragment (no '?' or '#')
//      key      the Idempotency-Key header value or undefined
//      body     the parsed JSON body (undefined when none)
//      traceId  the request's trace id; goes into every envelope this module builds
//    Bad appId / method / path / body → IdempotencyError('invalid_request') before anything else
//    (a programming error, not a client error); bad actor → 'invalid_subject'.
//    Scope of a record: (app_id, subject, method, path, key) — exactly the unique constraint.
//
//    Decision for an existing committed record of the scope (BR-ID-01 ④; BR-WDR-07 ⓪):
//      abandoned                      → 20903, without comparing the hash (BR-ID-10 细则)
//      completed, same request_hash   → replay: the stored status and body, byte for byte
//      completed, other request_hash  → 20901
//      processing (live)              → 40901, whatever the hash (待编排会话确认: 04 and BR-WDR-07
//                                       do not order 40901 against 20901 for a running request;
//                                       a running sensitive request is not visible at all, so the
//                                       standard mode answers 40901 as well)
//    Contention (task B1-01zt): both modes take the scope's advisory lock without waiting; when
//    another request holds it, the scope is read once without the lock (the committed state at
//    that moment): completed with the same request_hash → that replay; anything else (no visible
//    row, processing, abandoned, completed with another hash) → 40901. So concurrent retries of a
//    finished request all get the original response, and a different body under contention
//    still gets 40901 (20901 once the lock is free).
//    In each of these cases the handler is not called. Replay comes before everything the
//    handler checks (ban, version gate, step-up: BR-ID-01 ④ before ④a–⑮, BR-ID-08), so a
//    completed record is returned without calling the handler even when it would now refuse.
//
//    What is stored (BR-WDR-07; 04 §5): the handler's result is stored when its envelope `code`
//    is 0 or 30000–39999. Any other code (1xxxx, 2xxxx, 4xxxx, 5xxxx) is not stored: the key has
//    no record afterwards and the same key may be sent again (step-up replay with the original
//    key, BR-ID-08; transport retries). A handler that throws (or rejects) stores nothing either;
//    the same error object is rethrown unchanged.
//    Stored form: `response` jsonb is exactly {"status": <HTTP status>, "body": <body string>}
//    where the body string is the exact text returned to the first caller (section 5); a replay
//    returns that string unchanged (no re-serialisation: jsonb would reorder object keys).
//
//    Standard mode — `execute(request, handler: () => Promise<HandlerResult>)`:
//      - Refuses the four sensitive (method, path) pairs of section 6 with
//        IdempotencyError('transactional_required') (they must use executeInTransaction).
//      - No record: inserts a `processing` row (request_hash set, response null) and commits it
//        on its own, then calls the handler outside any transaction of this module. Concurrent
//        requests of the same scope: exactly one inserts (the unique constraint decides; a
//        conflict is never surfaced as an error, the loser re-reads and decides as above), the
//        others get 40901 while the row is processing.
//      - After the handler: stored result → the row becomes `completed` with `response`; result
//        not stored, or the handler threw → the row is deleted. Both updates are conditional on
//        the row still being this request's processing row (same id, status processing, same
//        created_at). If it is not (taken over, see the lease), nothing is written, exactly one
//        line is logged — `options.logger.warn({ method, path }, 'idempotency_record_lost')` —
//        and the handler's response is still returned (source 'handler').
//      - The `completed` write fails (task B1-01zh: the handler has already had its effect, so a
//        50001 "failure" would be untrue): it is retried a bounded number of times
//        (COMPLETION_ATTEMPTS, waits COMPLETION_RETRY_DELAYS_MS, well under a second in all),
//        each attempt with the same ownership condition (a takeover in between →
//        idempotency_record_lost as above, the taker's row is never overwritten). An attempt that
//        succeeds returns the handler's response. The whole of it (every attempt, connection
//        acquisition included, and the waits) has a client-side deadline,
//        COMPLETION_DEADLINE_MS, measured with a timer only (no clock read): a write that hangs
//        (network gone, TCP not yet reporting it; the pool has no acquire or query timeout) is
//        no longer awaited when it passes, no further attempt starts, and the request is
//        treated as "every attempt failed" below, so neither the request nor shutdown (HTTP
//        close waits for requests in flight) waits on the database. The abandoned write is left
//        to settle on its own: its rejection is swallowed, and it logs and changes nothing more.
//        If it later succeeds it is an ordinary `completed` write under the same ownership
//        condition (the stored response is the handler's own; a later retry of the key replays
//        it), which is acceptable; if it finds the row taken over it writes nothing. If every
//        attempt fails, the row is left as it is (processing, not deleted, not changed), exactly
//        one line is logged —
//        `options.logger.error({ method, path, attempts }, 'idempotency_completion_unknown')`
//        (warn when the logger has no error; never the driver error, whose message or detail
//        may carry parameters) — and the call rejects with IdempotencyError('outcome_unknown'),
//        which the HTTP layer answers by closing the connection as for the transactional mode.
//        The key then answers 40901 until the lease expires; a takeover after that runs the
//        handler again. This makes the answer honest, it does not make an external call happen
//        only once: the transactional mode protects only writes in this database, so a
//        per-call-billed external call needs its own idempotency and recovery.
//        The delete after a thrown or unstored handler is not retried (unchanged). After an
//        unstored result its failure rejects with the driver's error. After a thrown handler
//        (task B1-01zt) the handler's error is still rethrown unchanged; the failed delete only
//        logs one line — `error` (else warn) `({ method, path }, 'idempotency_cleanup_failed')`,
//        never the driver error, a body or a key — and the row stays processing (40901 until the
//        lease expires, then a takeover). The key is not stored either way.
//      - Lease (待编排会话确认; no document gives a value): a processing row whose created_at is
//        at least `processingLeaseMs` (default 60 000) before clock.now() is stale (its process
//        died or hangs): the next request of the scope takes it over atomically (conditional
//        update: request_hash of the new request, created_at and expire_at from now) and runs
//        its handler, whatever the old hash was. created_at more recent than that → 40901. The
//        business unique constraints are the last line against a double effect (规划/02 §18).
//
//    Transactional mode — `executeInTransaction(request, handler: (trx) => Promise<HandlerResult>)`
//    for the four step-up operations (BR-ID-10 细则「敏感操作的幂等键」「作废与业务结果互斥」;
//    BR-WDR-07 ⑧; 04 §3.2):
//      - One database transaction holds the key, calls the handler with it (`trx`, a Kysely
//        Transaction bound to schema app like the db handle) and writes the record. The business
//        writes the handler makes through `trx` and the record commit together or not at all.
//      - No processing row is ever committed for these operations: while the handler runs, no
//        other session can see any row of the scope (a process that dies leaves no trace; the
//        key goes back to "no record").
//      - A request of the same scope arriving while such a transaction is open gets 40901 without
//        waiting for that transaction to end (a short bounded wait is acceptable; the rule tests
//        allow 3 s while the first transaction stays open for longer). Suggested: a transaction-
//        scoped advisory lock taken with pg_try_advisory_xact_lock on a hash of the scope
//        (two-int4 form, so it never collides with the one-bigint locks of BR-WDR-07 ③), plus
//        INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING on the unique constraint, which stays the arbiter.
//      - Existing committed record → decided as above (abandoned → 20903 and the handler never
//        runs, so a key abandoned while the vendor call of PUT /v1/me/payout-account ran makes
//        that request roll back as a whole with 20903, BR-ID-10 细则).
//      - Stored result → commit with the `completed` row. Result not stored → roll back
//        everything (the handler's writes too) and return the response. Handler threw → roll
//        back, rethrow the same error.
//      - The commit itself fails (outcome unknown, e.g. the connection dropped during COMMIT) →
//        one line `error` (else warn) `({ method, path }, 'idempotency_commit_unknown')` (task
//        B1-01zt; never the driver error, a body or a key; also for the claim commit of the
//        standard mode) and reject with IdempotencyError('outcome_unknown'): the HTTP layer must then answer without
//        the envelope (close the connection), BR-ID-10 细则「服务端的配合」. A failure before
//        COMMIT rolls back and rejects with the driver's error.
//
//    HandlerResult = { status, envelope }: status an integer 200–599; envelope a plain object
//    with integer `code` ≥ 0, string `msg`, string `trace_id` and optional `data`. The body is
//    JSON.stringify(envelope) — the handler's key order is kept. Anything else →
//    IdempotencyError('invalid_result'), handled like a thrown handler (row deleted / rolled
//    back, nothing stored).
//    IdempotentResponse = plain object with exactly { status, body, source }:
//      source 'handler'      the handler ran in this call (body = JSON.stringify(envelope))
//             'replay'       a stored response, unchanged
//             'idempotency'  an envelope this module built (section 5) or the abandon result
//
// 5. Envelopes this module builds (contract ErrorEnvelope; contracts/error-codes.yaml http):
//    body = JSON.stringify of an object whose keys are in this order: code, msg, data (only when
//    listed), trace_id = request.traceId.
//      20001  HTTP 400  msg 'Idempotency-Key is missing or malformed'  data {"fields":["idempotency-key"]}
//      20901  HTTP 409  msg 'Idempotency-Key was used with a different request body'
//      20903  HTTP 409  msg 'Idempotency-Key was abandoned'
//      40901  HTTP 409  msg 'a request with this Idempotency-Key is in progress'
//    The field name is the header name lower-cased, as platform/validation names header fields.
//
// 6. Sensitive operations — `SENSITIVE_OPERATIONS` (04 §5 step-up row; BR-ID-08):
//      withdraw               POST /v1/withdrawals          retention unlimited
//      payout_account_change  PUT  /v1/me/payout-account    retention unlimited
//      phone_change           POST /v1/me/phone             retention 30 days
//      account_deletion       POST /v1/me/deletion          retention 30 days
//    POST /v1/me/phone also serves the first binding (no step-up); the path is shared, so every
//    POST /v1/me/phone uses executeInTransaction.
//
// 7. Retention — `expire_at` (BR-ID-30 ⑤; BR-WDR-07): every row this module writes gets
//    created_at = clock.now() and expire_at = created_at + 30 days (IDEMPOTENCY_RETENTION_MS =
//    2 592 000 000 ms), except the rows of POST /v1/withdrawals and PUT /v1/me/payout-account
//    (any status, abandoned included): expire_at = 'infinity' — "不按 30 天清理，保留期 ≥ 提现单
//    保留期", and the retention of withdrawals is still open (BR-ID-30 ⑫, no deletion task), so
//    these rows are kept (待编排会话确认). A completion keeps the row's created_at and expire_at;
//    a lease takeover sets both anew. The column default now() is never relied on.
//    `purgeExpired()` deletes every row (any status, any app) whose expire_at < clock.now() and
//    resolves with the number deleted; rows with expire_at = 'infinity' are never deleted. The
//    04:00 schedule that calls it belongs to the worker (BR-ID-30), not to this task.
//
// 8. Abandon primitive — `idempotency.abandon({ appId, userId, action, key, traceId })`
//    (04 §6.1; BR-ID-10 细则「作废接口」). The HTTP route is task B1-02; it passes the token's
//    app_id and user and the request body's action and idempotency_key.
//      - action not one of the four of section 6 and/or key outside the format of section 2 →
//        20001 (HTTP 400, msg 'invalid abandon request', data {"fields": [...]} listing 'action'
//        and/or 'idempotency_key' in that order); nothing is touched.
//      - userId must pass the userId format of section 1, else IdempotencyError('invalid_subject').
//      - Scope: (appId, `u:<userId>`, method and path of the action, key). Atomically, under the
//        unique constraint: no record → insert {status abandoned, request_hash null, response
//        null, user_id userId, created_at now, expire_at per section 7} and answer abandoned;
//        abandoned record → abandoned again (no second row); completed record → completed with
//        `original`, nothing written; processing record, or the key held by an open transaction
//        of executeInTransaction → 40901 without waiting for it (as in section 4).
//      - Answer: HTTP 200, source 'idempotency', body JSON.stringify of
//        {code: 0, msg: '', data: {outcome, original}, trace_id} where original is null for
//        abandoned, and for completed the stored envelope reduced to {code, msg, data} (in that
//        order; `data` only when the stored envelope has it; no trace_id), unchanged otherwise.
//      - Banned or deleting accounts are not this primitive's concern (10006 / 10007 whitelists
//        are the route's, BR-ID-31, BR-ID-27); it grants no right to run the original operation.
//
// 9. Factory — `createIdempotency({ db, clock, logger, processingLeaseMs? })`
//    db: Kysely<DB> bound to schema app (platform/db `db` handle, role couli_app); clock: Clock —
//    the only source of time (no Date.now(), no new Date() without argument, no SQL now() for
//    values written or compared); logger: anything with pino's warn(fields, msg) and, optionally,
//    error(fields, msg) (warn is used in its place when absent).
//    processingLeaseMs: an integer from 1 000 to 600 000 (default 60 000), else
//    IdempotencyError('invalid_option'). Creating touches neither db nor clock.
//
// 10. Logging and errors. The module logs nothing but the lines of section 4 (never a body, a
//     key value, a hash or a stored response). IdempotencyError: name 'IdempotencyError', `code`,
//     the fixed message of its code (IDEMPOTENCY_ERROR_MESSAGES); own properties exactly stack,
//     message, name and code; no cause. Database errors other than the handled unique conflict
//     (and the lock-not-available of the bounded wait) reject with the driver's error.
//
// 11. Wiring (implementation of this task; outside what the rule tests import): PlatformModule
//     provides token IDEMPOTENCY = createIdempotency({ db: DB handle, clock: CLOCK, logger:
//     ROOT_LOGGER }) when database handles exist, exported from platform/index.ts. No global HTTP
//     hook or interceptor: controllers / use cases of the operations marked I call execute or
//     executeInTransaction (the transactional handler needs `trx`), after signature and token
//     checks (BR-ID-01 ①–③) and before everything else. The abandon route is B1-02.
//     Stage ④a (B1-03c): every instance carries the post-miss check list of ./post-miss.ts,
//     awaited in both modes after a miss or before an expired-lease takeover, before any write,
//     and an entry observer list called first in both modes (risk uses it to tell "the
//     idempotency module disposed of this request" from "the route never reached it").
//     While a post-miss check runs, idempotencyPostMissTransaction() returns the
//     transaction of the claim that holds the advisory lock, so a check that reads the database
//     reads on that connection instead of borrowing a second one from the pool (a pool full of
//     claims would otherwise wait on itself). It is passed through an AsyncLocalStorage, not as a
//     second argument, so the checks keep the one-argument call the rule tests pin.
//
// 12. Rules for the implementation: this file is compiled by the `test` project too
//     (erasableSyntaxOnly, no decorators): erasable syntax only (no parameter properties, enum,
//     namespace, decorators), no NestJS, `import type` for type-only imports, relative imports
//     with `.ts`. Runtime imports only: `node:crypto`, `node:async_hooks`, `kysely`, and files of
//     this directory;
//     `@couli/db` and `../clock/index.ts` type-only. No process.env.
