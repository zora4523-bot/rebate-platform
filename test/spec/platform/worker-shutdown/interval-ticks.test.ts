// B2-15q rule test (claude-independent, D10-553; review r1): the ticks of the interval. After the
// first seconds of a worker's life the interval ticks are the only ticks there are, so a stop waits
// for them as it does for the seed timer's tick. ticks.test.ts and handshake.int.test.ts hold that
// first tick only, on gates that open once; those files are frozen at spec_commit, so the gate that
// can shut again lives here (`latchedDb`, same pool shape as kit.ts gatedDb).
//
// #8 and #10: the tick held is one the interval started, after earlier ticks have ended: an
// implementation that tracks the seed timer's tick alone has nothing left to wait for. #9 and #10:
// the interval comes due while a tick is held: `inFlight = tick()` at the interval's call site, with
// a tick that returns early while one runs, overwrites the promise of the tick still running. #11:
// the same on a failed tick, and a failed tick does not stop the next one.
//
// A tick is one or two statements, so the gate only shuts between two ticks (`firstTickEnded` and
// the drains after an opened gate: with no gate every statement ends in microtasks). Every test is
// red on the old modules at `stop.outcome()`, because their stop returns at once. Fake module timers
// and bounded waits as in ticks.test.ts. Top-level it() only (规划/11 §4.3).
